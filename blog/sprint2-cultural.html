                    1. <u>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My long term goal is to acquire the skills necessary for a career in software development.  I would like to be able to leave EDA with the confidence to find a job and continue to learn about the industry while I work.  I currently have an interest in artificial intelligence and would love to pursue this pathway given the opportunity.
                </p>
                <p class="next-question">
                    2. <u>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am hoping to learn more about how to work effectively in a team environment and I would like to develop my own work flow - that is, work more efficiently and know when to take breaks to optimise my output.
                </p>
                <p class="next-question">
                    3. <u>A description of your own strengths and limitations</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My strengths are that I have a high level of focus, I am a hard worker and I have strong time management skills. My main limitation is that I often strive for perfection and sometimes become engrossed and frustrated when trying to solve a problem for a prolonged period of time without success.
                </p>
                <p class="next-question">
                    4. <u>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that the EDA programme has begun, I am committed to making it a priority.  This week I have been overseas on holiday and am proud to say that I worked on sprint two almost every day for at least a couple of hours, something I would never have even considered before now.  Because of this, I managed to finish within the recommended time frame and am ready to start sprint three this coming Monday. I feel motivated to learn as much as possible in the short time I have here and take advantage of all the opportunities presented to me.  During foundations I plan to be on premises at least four days a week so I can get to know my cohort and also have facilitators available if I get stuck.  I plan to follow the time box suggestions and track the amount of time spent on each activity by using Toggle.  I also plan to exercise at least four times a week, keep social engagements to a minimum and make sure I get a decent amount of sleep each night so I am ready to absorb each day!

                <p class="next-question">
                    5. <u>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I often find it difficult to ask for help and prefer to simmer over a problem until I finally solve it myself. I think being at EDA will help me with this.  I plan to use the slack app to ask my peers for help if I get stuck and I will also ask for help from facilitators when I am really stuck. 
                </p>
                <p class="next-question">
                    6. <u>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would expect tech support (obviously!) but mostly I would expect to be told if I could be doing things in a better way. Be that something technical to do with a project, or constructive criticism or just general feedback.  I would like to come out of this experience having learned as much as possible and any help with this would be great.
                </p>
                <p class="next-question">
                    7. <u>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only real block-out time I had was this week while I was overseas and I am quite happy with how I managed my time overall. I feel confident that I will be able to manage any other small commitments that may come along during my time here.
