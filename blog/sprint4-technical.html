                <h4 class="anecdotes">1. A Time I Got Stuck</h4>
                <p>
                    Let’s talk about this morning when I was trying to use the terminal on my computer to update something on GitHub.  Yes, I had followed all of the instructions, and yet my account just would not update. Why!  Naturally I tried google first, and thought that maybe it was just taking longer than usual to push the changes through. So I waited and refreshed, and waited and refreshed - still nothing.  I went back to the instructions and made sure I hadn’t missed anything - no luck.  I checked my work for spelling errors other obvious mistakes - zilch.  By now I was beginning to feel frustrated but was determined to figure out where I had gone wrong.  So I decided to go back to the terminal and read the output from when I pushed the changes.  It hadn’t thrown an error message, so I knew something had happened, but maybe there was a clue in the output. Bingo! There it was in black & white - an instruction of what to do next.  Moral of the story - read the output!  Sometimes it’s helpful to read the gibberish that the computer spits out, even when there is no error message.

                <h4 class="anecdotes">2. Solving a Problem in a (Relatively) Elegant Way</h4>
                <p>
                    Last week we worked our way through FreeCodeCamp’s Basic JavaScript course.  I enjoyed working my way through the modules and completing the challenges on each page.  But about half way through, there was a problem that I just could not solve.  I had started off alright, trying to incorporate the concept we had just been taught into my code but when I tested it by printing the output to the console, it just wouldn’t work the way it was supposed to.  Also when I was about half way through writing my function I would get a bit lost and have to re-trace my steps to figure it out again.  Mostly at this point I was feeling confused and unequipped to be able to figure out my error by trial and error.  So I went to the hints section and used those to try to work my way through it. The hints weren’t super helpful, I felt like I had already done what they were suggesting without any success, so in the end I looked to the solution.  When I saw the solution, I could definitely see where I had gone wrong, but the main reason I had gotten so confused was because of a badly-worded question.  The way we had been asked to complete the exercise was so confusing to me that even though I understood the overall brief, I went about it in completely the wrong way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went back to this problem a couple of days later.  This time I wrote down the requirements <i>in my own words</i> and broke the process down into manageable steps.  I crossed these steps off as I completed them.  What I found was my first attempt at solving the problem was much closer to the actual solution than it had been two days prior. I also found that I understood my code much better, and I was able to follow it more easily than before.  I solved the problem after one or two adjustments and felt confident I could do it again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I learned was how important it is to be clear on what is being asked, and to have a clear strategy about how we’re going to approach a problem before we start solving it.

                <h4 class="anecdotes">Pseudocode</h4>
                <p>
                    Pseudocode is a step-by-step written outline of your code We can use it to plan out the function of an algorithm before beginning the more technical task of coding.  It will take a bit of practise to become confident in writing pseudocode that is descriptive and concise.

                <h4 class="anecdotes">Trying Something</h4>
                <p>
                    Also known as trial-and-error, this is obviously a common method of problem-solving.  Trying something will give us a starting point, then we can refine it as we learn which parts aren’t working.  I feel confident in this problem solving-technique as it is one I regularly use.
                </p>
                <h4 class="anecdotes">Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
                <p>
                    The Rubber Ducky Method is as follows:
                    <ol id="ducky">
                        <li>
                            Obtain a rubber duck.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that’s all right.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by line.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing. The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This method of problem solving seems very <strike>strange</strike> intuitive because when explaining our code to the duck, in order to make the duck understand, we are forced to be precise and pay very careful attention to our process.  It makes us slow down and really think about what we are trying to achieve and so many of the bugs and issues we have originate from our instructions not being clear and explicit enough for the computer.  So by explaining our code to a duck, we often magically find the flaw in our code.

                    Reading Error Messages
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I am beginning to realise the value of error messages.  Error messages often tell us <i>exactly</i> why our code isn’t working and also the exact <i>location</i> in our code where this has error has occurred, so by reading them we can gain valuable insight into why our code is not working the way we want it to.

                    Logging to the Console
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Logging things to the console is very handy as it allows us to check when our code is working. For example, when writing a function that takes parameters, we can call it with random arguments inputted and log the result to the console to check if the return value is the same as what we were expecting.  This is often how I check if my code is correct and this concept is also used when writing tests for our code.

                    Googling
                </h4>
                <p>
                    An obvious and common choice of problem solving.  Something I think most people would feel confident using.

                    Asking Peers and Coaches for Help
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Sometimes asking peers for help can be difficult but I am finding it very useful as everyone has been very helpful and non-judgemental when giving tips or solutions.  My confidence in asking peers for help is definitely improving, and I also feel confident asking coaches for help, when I get really stuck.
                </p>
                <h4 class="anecdotes">Improving the Process with Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                    Reflection has been helpful to me as it forces me to think about not only what I have learned but how I have learned things, and if this has been effective or not.  When we can recognise learning strategies that work well for us, we can employ them going forward when we are trying to learn more complex concepts.
