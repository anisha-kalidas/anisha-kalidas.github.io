                    How helpful I find mindfulness.

                <p class="next-question">
                    <u>3. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing an introduction about myself that was concise but also representative of me as a person.
                </p>
                <p class='next-question'>
                    <u>4. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    From speaking to other people who have completed the course, what I gather is that the course is very intensive and can sometimes be overwhelming.  By being aware of how we and those around us respond in such situations, we can help each other to learn in the most effective way.  Also, these days we work largely in teams, not in isolation, so realising and recognising emotions in ourselves and others can lead to healthier working environments.

                <p class="next-question">
                    <u>5. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    No, it hasn’t felt like a waste of time.  I have definitely spent more time on the technical material, but I have found the core material very useful in helping me to realise the best way to learn and retain the technical information.
