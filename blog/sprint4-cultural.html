                        <p>
                            Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to modify its connections or re-wire itself. Without this ability, any brain would be unable to develop from infancy through to adulthood or recover from brain injury.   Like a physical muscle, the brain gets stronger the more you use it.  Neuroplasticity allows us to learn new skills, such as playing an instrument, learning a language or playing a new sport.  Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can benefit us all, once we understand that we are able to shape our brain by choosing what we focus our minds on.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            Neuroplasticity can help make our lives better as we can rewire our brains to establish better habits that contribute to our overall health, success, and well-being.  Our brains are affected by how we think and how we think is affected by our brains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of my own benefit, I think I can engage with the principals of neuroplasticity throughout the Dev Academy programme.  Becoming a developer feels more achievable when I think about how the brain is malleable and that the more I practise and apply myself, the better I’ll get and the easier it will become. I think it’s key to remember this especially in times of difficulty.

                        <p>
                            Growth mindset is the understanding that abilities and intelligence can be developed.  When a person has a growth mindset, they believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger. Therefore they put in extra time and effort, and that leads to higher achievement.  Growth mindset is relevant because instead of thinking we cannot do something, we believe that we are can’t do it <i>yet</i>, that we can become better if we practise and apply ourselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While exploring this topic I was surprised to learn that during one study, a control group increased their muscle strength by 22% simply by <i>thinking</i> about doing hand exercises, compared the group or actually <i>did</i> the hand exercises, who increased their muscle strength by 30%.  This was because the neurons responsible for the movement were still being used and strengthened, resulting in increased strength when the muscles actually contracted.  This was amazing to me, to realise that we can increase our physical strength, simply by changing our mindset!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I definitely think I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey.  For me I think the most relevant part of growth mindset is to understand that my ability is not there <i>yet</i>, but I can get to where I want to be with hard work and practise.

                        <p>
                            This exploration has made me understand the importance of taking care of our brain health, and to optimise this in order to learn a new skill efficiently and effectively.  My learning plan already includes some ways to achieve this - regular exercise and getting enough sleep - but now I am also thinking about the importance of a balanced diet and practising mindfulness.  These are things I would like to incorporate into my learning journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would also like to actively practise a growth mindset.  I know that there will be parts of this course I will find challenging and I’ll feel like I’m out of my depth but I think now I understand <i>better</i> that I can definitely achieve my goals with the right amount of effort and application.
