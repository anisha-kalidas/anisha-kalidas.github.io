                <p>
                    1. <u>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a pharmacist I have had to make ethical decisions on more than one occasion.  One of the most memorable decisions was receiving a phone call from the mother of a patient who had been dispensed medication from our pharmacy.  She called to ask what the medication was used for.  She was very concerned for her sixteen year old daughter’s health and wellbeing and was asking for my help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For legal and ethical reasons, I was unable to disclose any information about the patient without their explicit permission, even to their legal guardian.  However at the same time, I empathised with the mother and could understand her worry and concern for her daughter.  I was also aware that the lady I was speaking to may become upset or angry when I explain to her that I can’t disclose this information, she was after all her mother. I asked the woman on the phone to please hold for a moment while I located her daughters file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I returned to the phone call I explained to the mother that unfortunately due to privacy laws I was unable to provide any information about the medication without her daughter’s permission, even though she is a minor.  I offered to sit down with the two of them in the pharmacy and have a conversation about the medication if her daughter would like, but unfortunately could not disclose anything without her daughter being present.  As expected, she was not happy and was beginning to become aggressive, stating that sixteen year olds should not be prescribed medication without a parent present. I told her I understood her concern and wished I could be of more help, repeated that it was a matter of legality, and that I would be more than happy to have a conversation with her daughter present.  I gave her my contact details and encouraged her to contact me again if she would like to set up a meeting.  In the end she was reluctant but seemed to accept the outcome.  I did not hear from her again.

                <p class="next-question">
                    2. <u>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a second-generation New Zealand born Indian, and have lived in Auckland my whole life.  My husband is a first-generation NZ born Indian from Christchurch and our families originate from the same small village in India - total coincidence!  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel lucky to have been immersed in two very different cultures growing up - the kiwi way of life, and also a traditional Indian upbringing.  Because of this I identify wholly as a “Kiwi Indian” and believe that these two cultures have played different roles in shaping the values I hold today.  I believe that my most core value is family. I have been lucky enough to be surrounded by a large extended family growing up, which has taught me the importance of always supporting each other.  It also taught me the importance of sharing, and knowing when to put the needs of others above my own.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another core value of mine is self-improvement.  I believe it is important to be aware of your limitations and to always be trying to improve yourself.  This is part of the reason I decided to attend EDA.  I had come to a standstill in my career and was not happy at the prospect of not learning further or moving forward.  However at the same time I value the experiences and knowledge I gained from my years as a pharmacist and hope to utilise these in my journey to becoming a software developer.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I believe another core value of mine is integrity.  I envision this term to cover many different values; honesty, responsibility, consistency, reliability.  It is important to stay accountable for your actions and take responsibility for your own decisions and learnings.  I believe we can only ascend in this life if we can identify our shortcomings, take responsibility to improve them ourselves, and have the support of our family to help us achieve our goals.
                </p>
                
                <p class="next-question">
                    3. <u>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My strengths are that I have a high level of focus, I am a hard worker and I have strong time management skills.  My main limitation is that I often strive for perfection and sometimes become engrossed and frustrated when trying to solve a problem for a prolonged period of time without success.  In terms of career development I believe that my strengths will help me to learn new concepts and overcome challenges.  When it comes to my limitations, I know that I will often need to accept that things cannot always be perfect, and a lot of the time sub-perfection is adequate.  I will also have to work on my patience when trying to solve difficult problems, and learn to take breaks before becoming frustrated so I can come back to the problem later on with a clear head.
                </p>

                <p class="next-question">
                    4. <u>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that my strength of being a hard worker and having a high level of focus intersects with my tendency to get engrossed in a project and become frustrated when I can’t solve a problem.  I think asking for help before I get to this stage will be helpful for my learning journey.
                </p>

                <p class="next-question">
                    5. <u>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I started work as a manager in my previous job, it was my first job in a leadership role and right away I was met with resistance from two staff members.  They had become comfortable working in an environment where bad behaviours had been widely accepted and shared by the previous manager and viewed me as a threat since this was the reason I had been appointed manager.  I spent some time meeting the staff over the first couple of weeks (approximately 20 staff members) and observing their habits and behaviours in the beginning as I was afraid to rock the boat too quickly.  I decided to approach the two staff members privately when I observed these bad behaviours.  I explained to them why I had been hired and how there were going to be some changes for everyone in the team and asked if they had any suggestions about how we could run things more smoothly overall.  Unfortunately I was met with hostility and indifference and the conversation died.  I feel that my strategies were not very effective in this instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In hindsight, I think I would adopt a more direct strategy, instead of waiting to observe the team.  I would organise a meeting with all staff members to introduce myself and explain why I have been appointed manager, clearly state my expectations and what my goals are for the business.  I would then open the floor to all staff members, asking if they have any recommendations about how we can improve the running of the business and brainstorm ideas together as a group as to how we can achieve this.  I would then assure them that they are welcome to approach me in private if they have any concerns they wouldn’t like to raise in a group environment and I would also make it clear that any behaviour not in-line with expectations would not be tolerated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach is much more direct and forward compared to the approach I applied, but I hope that it would be more effective in achieving a better outcome overall.  I think that involving all staff members in the decision-making process and setting expectations from the very beginning would ensure that everyone is clear on what is acceptable and what is unacceptable.  I hope that they would also feel comfortable to approach me with any concerns or questions they might have so that we would have open communication and a better working relationship resulting in a more smoothly run business.
