                    My long term goal is to acquire the skills necessary for a career in software development. I currently have an interest in artificial intelligence and would love to pursue this pathway given the opportunity.  I would like to leave this course with the knowledge of the best way to learn a new coding language so I can further my skills following completion of the programme.  I haven’t thought much about the impact I would like to make but I think I would like to work for a company that is changing the way the world works.. hence my interest in artificial intelligence.

                    In my foundations learning plan I listed my strengths as having a high level of focus and good time management.  I believe these things helped me complete the challenges in sprints four and five and will continue to help me throughout bootcamp.  In terms of limitations I mentioned that I often strive for perfection and can get frustrated when trying to solve a problem for a prolonged period of time without success. I think in the last few weeks I have made an effort to realise this limitation, and have become better at taking regular breaks away from the computer and also asking for help before getting to the point of frustration.  This as well as practising mindfulness has definitely helped me complete challenges more efficiently.  This is something I’d like to continue to work on.

                    During foundations I have found that the core material has really helped me in terms of absorbing the technical material and optimising my learning. Throughout bootcamp there are a few non-technical skills I would like to develop within myself.  These include, improving my leadership skills, working to complete a project within a team environment, and also building confidence speaking in front of a group or presenting my work.  I think that my biggest challenge will be to not have such high expectations of myself and this is something I would like to work on during bootcamp.

                    From what I know about bootcamp, the workload is about four to five times that of foundations.  This is obviously a lot but I feel motivated to learn as much as possible in the short time I have here and take advantage of all the opportunities presented to me.  Aside from being prepared for this workload, I understand the need for balance and to look after my mental health as well.  I plan to exercise at least four times a week, keep social engagements to a minimum and make sure I get a decent amount of sleep each night so that my productivity is at it’s best.  I also understand the importance communication and staying accountable when working in teams, this is something I will do my best to be aware of at all times.

                    My expectations of the bootcamp team are similar to those of the facilitation team.  Mostly I would expect to be told if I could be doing things in a better way, be that something technical or non-technical, or constructive criticism or just general feedback.  I have enjoyed the weekly catchups with my facilitator and have found them very encouraging and a good environment to raise any questions or concerns about my learning.  Overall I would like to come out of this experience having learned as much as possible and any help with this would be great.
